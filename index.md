### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, Part 2 is a favorite because it got me excited to learn about C++.
    I’ve always wanted to try programming, and being able to do it firsthand
    was great. I enjoyed prompting an input in the terminal and printing an
    output that involved my input. I learned the basics of “cout” and “cin”.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, Part 2 is another favorite because having a refined version of the
    blackjack program was a nice ending. I enjoy playing blackjack,
    so naturally, this lab fascinated me. I also liked the idea that a program
    I created served a purpose that solved a problem (not a critical problem,
    but a problem non the less). I learned how to use vectors and refined my
    usage of bool.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, Part 2 is my concluding favorite because it was exciting using two
    different commands for one program. Usually, you run one command and have
    multiple inputs. However, this lab was different because you had to
    initialize the secret number with “./secret” and guess the number with
    “./guess”. This minor detail made the lab feel more interactive. I learned
    how to use I/O file classes.
